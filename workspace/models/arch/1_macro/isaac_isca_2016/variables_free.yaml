  # DEFINITIONS:
  # - Cell: Smallest structure capable of storing memory. Note that a cell may
  #         store more than one bit. For example, a cell consisting of a RRAM
  #         device may store >1 bits, while a cell consisting of an SRAM
  #         bitcell may store only 1 bit. 
  # - CiM Unit: Smallest structure capable of computing an analog MAC.
  # - CiM Unit Width Cells: 
  #     Number of CiM unit cells that are accessed as one. These cells receive
  #     one analog input and compute one analog MAC per timestep.
  # - CiM Unit Depth Cells: 
  #     Number of independent groups of "CiM Unit Width" cells that form a CiM
  #     unit. Each of these groups is indepently addressible and operates in
  #     must be activated in a different timestep than the others.
