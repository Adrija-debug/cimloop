    energy due to fewer analog outputs being read from the array and written to
    the output buffer.

    This test explores the energy, area, and latency of the accelerator when
    running full DNN workloads with and without speculation.

    We can observe the following:
    - Speculation generally reduces energy and increases latency due to the factors
      described in the previous test.
    - RAELLA is more energy efficient for layers with more input channels due to
      higher utilization of arrays (which leads to lower ADC energy, per the
      Titanium Law described in the paper).
    - Energy and latency can also increase for layers with signed inputs (e.g., many
      Transformer layers) because RAELLA processes signed inputs in two different
      cycles, which increases the number of array activations and ADC uses.
